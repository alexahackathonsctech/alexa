# alexa
An Alexa feature that will allow you to ask if something is recyclable or not. This is useful for the modern day American who is probably too lazy to Google if something is recyclable, and will most likely huck whatever they have into the trash without a shred of doubt or remorse for the millions of pounds of trash that are piling up in our landfills and spilling out into our oceans :)

lol jk it hopefully just makes it easier for people to check if something is recyclable without having to put down their trash bag or whatever and search it up on their phones.
